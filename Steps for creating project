# Stress-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
Steps For Creating Project
1. Import numpy and pandas
2. Import Dataset
3. Check Description of out data
4. Check if dataset contains null value or not
5. Prepare the text column of this dataset to clean the text column with stopwords,links,special symbols and language errors
6. View the most utilized words by individuals sharing about their life issues via online entertainment by picturing a word cloud of the text column
7. The label column in this dataset contains labels as 0 and 1. 0 means no stress, and 1 means stress. We will use Stress and No stress lables instead of 1 and 0. So lets prepare this column accordingly and select the text and label columns for the process of training a machine learning model
8. Split the dataset into training and test sets
9. This task is based on the problem of binary classification, We will be using the Bernoulli Naive Bayes algorithm,which one of the best algorithm for binary classification
10. Test the performance of our model on some random sentences based on mental health
Ex:- "I think we need to take care of ourselves"
Ex:- "I am feeling sad"
